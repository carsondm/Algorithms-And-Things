# Algorithms-And-Things
Little repo for brushing up on classic algorithms

This started as a 60 lines of code per day challenge.
Not sure that there'll be 60 new lines here every day, as there's other stuff I want to work on as well.

I'm planning on going through most of the sorting algorithms, data structures, and some other algorithms like the sieve or traveling salesman.
